# Semestral project for Physical Optics
This project is an implementation to the semestral project for course FYO at BUT FIT.

# Contents
The repository should contain:
 - `bin/` - contains all data to run the project as executable on Windows 10.
 - `doc/` - contains all the documentation files - `xburka00_thesis.pdf` which contains the thesis and `xburka00_prez.pdf` which contains the support presentation.
 - `src/` - contains all Python support libraries.
 - `main.py` - main python file if you decide not to run the script as executable.

# Running the project
As requested in the assignment this project is made to run on Windows 10 without installing any additional tools whatsoever. For this purpose an executable was created from the original Python script using PyInstaller module. Therefore this project can be run and already contains all the necessary dependencies.

To run the project please simply navigate into the `bin/` directory and run the `main.exe`. Afterwards a terminal window should appear and shortly after the program should run.
